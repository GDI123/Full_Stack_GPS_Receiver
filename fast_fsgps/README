----------
This is the speed enhanced version of fsgps. It uses the same techniques as
the slow version, but is optmized to work with 16,368MHz sample rate.

Because eveything is fixed, it can process data 32 bits at a time, and 
can track 300x(!) faster than the original version.

Changing it to a different or variable sample rate would be very hard, but
you are willing to try email mail me and I'll send you some pointers
